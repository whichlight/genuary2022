        <li><a href="day22/day22_1.html">day 22: make something that will look completely different in a year</a>
            <br>I made a sketch for this prompt but it didn't really fit.
            I got obsessed with the idea of something mapped to clock time.
            while it captured the change quality, it didn't really seem to change enough -
            it didn't look completely different after a year.

    <h2>a few highlights from the genuary site:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>GENUARY is back! GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful
            things.
        </li>
        <li>Don't get burned out doing dailies. <br> This is supposed to be fun and creative. <br> If you start to
            resent dailies, or you find that it's stunting you creatively,<br> then ramp down your goals (and time
            spent) to just what you want to get out of this. <br>Fun? Practicing skills? Learning? Breaking boredom?
            Getting ideas? <br> It's fine to skip days. If you've been on a streak and only have a few days left, you've
            got this.</li>
