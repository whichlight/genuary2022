    <h1>genuary 2022</h1>
    <p>here's my sketchbook for the <a href="https://genuary2022.github.io/" target="_blank">genuary 2022</a> prompts.
        i haven't creative coded in a while so this will be a nice time
        to get back into it ^_^ </p>
    <p>a few highlights from the genuary site:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GENUARY is back! GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful
            things.
        </li>
        <li>Don't get burned out doing dailies. <br> This is supposed to be fun and creative. <br> If you start to
            resent dailies, or you find that it's stunting you creatively,<br> then ramp down your goals (and time
            spent) to just what you want to get out of this. <br>Fun? Practicing skills? Learning? Breaking boredom?
            Getting ideas? <br> It's fine to skip days. If you've been on a streak and only have a few days left, you've
            got this.</li>
    </ul>
